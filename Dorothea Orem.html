Dorothea Orem was a twentieth century nurse and theorist who developed the theory of self-care, <br>
which focuses on the metaparadigm of person. She was honored with honorary degrees from several universities <br>
in addition to other recognition for her accomplishments and contributions to the nursing profession. <br>
The self-care deficit theory, the theory of nursing systems, and the theory of self-care <br>
are the three parts of her theory. Giving people the knowledge and resources they need <br>
to take charge of their own health and wellbeing is Orem's primary focus.<br>
Orem thinks that because nurses are leaders in this process and can help patients <br>
learn the right techniques for achieving optimal self-care, they are essential to it.<br>

 A person's <i>health</i> is vital to their existence. According to Orem's research, <br>
 individuals who prioritize self-care tend to have longer and happier lives than those who don't. <br>
 Her Theory of Self-Care emphasizes how health problems deteriorate in the absence of self-care. <br>
 Failed self-care includes eating a poor diet, ignoring obesity or high blood pressure, <br>
 and even allowing a sickness to take control of every aspect of one's life. <br>
 Those who practice self-care are more likely to seek medical attention when they are ill. <br>
 It encourages people to look after their own needs and to keep their long-term health in mind.<br>

Self-care is encouraged not only in the hospitals, but also outside of the hospitals by family, friends, and coworkers. <br>
 Orem emphasizes the value of <i>environment</i> by saying that for a family member suffering from cancer <br>
 to stay well and joyful, they must be surrounded by supporting people. Support networks ensure that <br>
 loved ones are taking proper care of themselves, preventing patients from engaging in self-neglect. <br>
 Remaining away from things that are harmful to one's health is another aspect of self-care. <br>
 This covers abusing drugs or alcohol, smoking, following a bad diet, or doing anything similar.<br>
<br>

The <i>patient</i> is the center of attention and the top priority in the healthcare system. <br>
Although they all had slightly different perspectives on what a person is, Jean Watson, <br>
Florence Nightingale, and Dorothea Orem did have certain commonalities. <br>
Among those beliefs is the notion that since every patient is different, they should all receive personalized care. <br>
Orem acknowledged that nurses provide care for a variety of patients, and that each patient <br>
will require a unique approach. Despite being a strong proponent of self-care, <br>
she accepted that every one of her patients will have different needs.<br>
<br>
<br>

The core of the healthcare system is the nurse. In light of this, Orem's Theory of Self-Care illustrates <br>
the metaparadigm of <i>nursing</i>. While patients are the focal point of self-care, nurses play a critical role <br>
in the treatment of illnesses and therapies.<br>
The purpose of nurses' care is to guide patients through the healing process and aid in their recovery. <br>
Peritoneal dialysis is not a skill that most people are naturally gifted with. The nurse needs to instruct them <br>
on how to accomplish that. By imparting the necessary knowledge to their patients, nurses promote self-care. <br>
They understand that every person is unique and needs a different kind of care <br>
in order to impart the necessary knowledge.<br>
