Some may be concerned that as modern medicine progresses, healthcare <br>
may become more analytical and less altruistic. <br>
American nurse and theorist Jean Watson created the <br>
Theory of Human Caring in response to this concern.<br>
According to Watson's method, caring and curing are two different things. <br>
According to her, the term "curing" encompasses not only<br> the physical recovery from an illness<br>
but also the mental and spiritual aspects of healing. <br>
Nursing should take into account "carative" aspects in addition to curative ones, <br>
or those that deal with a patient's physical problems. <br>The guidelines that contemporary nurses <br>
can utilize to practice healing of the mind, body, <br>
and spirit are provided by carative elements. <br>These elements show the difference between nursing and medicine<br>
 and offer the structural foundation for <b>Watson's Theory of Caring</b>.<br>

 Watson's definition of <i>health</i> is said to involve far more than just treating a disease. <br>
She thinks that while healing is essential, it goes well beyond a body's reaction.<br>
Nurses must treat patients holistically—that is, with an emphasis on the mind, body, and soul—in order to promote wellness. <br>
According to her, a person's bodily, mental, and spiritual selves must all be in perfect balance for healing to take place.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Environment.gif" alt="Environment" style="width:150px;height:150px;"><br>
Watson firmly believes that the nursing process is greatly influenced by the <i>environment</i>.<br>
Nurses might be impacted by their surroundings in addition to patients and how well they recuperate.<br>
One instance given included a nursing unit that had an unprecedented drop in morale. <br>
Due to this the nursing management came up with the notion to implement some of Watson's philosophies on the unit as a result,<br>
Staff members found this to be quite helpful, and in the end, this strengthened the relationships and<br>
morale within the unit among coworkers (Summerell, 2015). <br>
<br>
<br>

Watson advances the profession by her interpretation of the nursing metaparadigm, <i>person</i>.<br>
of providing for human needs via human care. Regardless of a person's desires, cultures, or beliefs, <br>
she feels that each person has a distinct and unpredictable set of requirements that must be accepted and honored.<br>
She also believes that a holistic approach that addresses the mind, body, and soul is essential for a person <br>
to receive full healing.

In articulating her opinions regarding the metaparadigm of <i>nursing</i>, Watson feels that<br>
Building ties with patients is critical for nurses. She notes that even though<br>
Although science and medicine are important therapeutic components, they are not always the most prevalent<br>
elements. It is equally crucial that providing care be considered a crucial aspect of nursing.<br>
process by keeping the patient's needs in mind and making sure that nurses will attend to<br>
patients' mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. <br>
