As a nurse, Florence Nightingale spent the majority of her life serving people in<br>
the nineteenth century. Nightingale proved throughout her life that altering a person's<br>
surroundings can promote health in addition to medicine saving lives. <br>
It has never been thoroughly studied previously how a patient's surroundings are in a medical setting.
Nightingale was a nurse who worked in British hospitals and kept track of hospital mortality <br>
when the Crimean War broke out in 1854. She started implementing evidence-based practice <br>
to make changes to the surroundings that would encourage a healthier atmosphere. <br>
Among the improvements she made were cleaner surroundings, better meals, and water for the hospital. <br>
She found that she could significantly improve health <br>
after only a year of altering her surroundings (McDonald, 2014).

 Naturally, the most important consideration in patient care is health. <br>
 According to Nightingale's concept, nurses may significantly enhance a person's health by providing care, <br>
 keeping a clean environment, being prepared, and attending to other medical needs. <br>
 Her idea is grounded in the 19th century, and it is encouraging that she was able to <br>
 understand the significance of certain fundamental medical necessities in her day, <br>
 such as food and clean water (Stichler, 2014).<br>
<br>

She effectively established the metaparadigm of modern nursing on <i> environment</i>.<br>
Essentially of the surroundings in promoting patient health in the healthcare industry. <br>Set by Florence Nightingale, the
criterion that is still applied to the nursing profession today. Not much existed in the early 19th century.<br>
Before there was no importance given to elimination of microorganisms and the spread and acquisition of infections.<br>
But due to her initiative, physicians and nurses in Nightingale's day were more concerned with treating illnesses.<br> 
Resulting to the growth in the number of people in the medical field, that we're concentrating on<br>
aseptic procedures or cleaning strategies, such as bleaching and limiting the growth of germs. <br>
<br>

Nightingale concentrated on the surroundings for the <i> person</i> or individual, even if her philosophy was based on the environment. <br>
Medically speaking, you wouldn't require an environment if the individual wasn't there. <br>
"Nightingale's environmental theory can be viewed as a systems model that focuses on the client in the center,<br>
 surrounded by aspects of the environment all in balance" (Zborowsky, 2014).<br>
 In this sense, her theory's main focus is on helping the patient's body, mind, and spirit. <br>
 Nightingale was able to identify what made people peaceful, what made them more nervous, <br>
 and what made them agitated through assessments and observations.<br>
<br>

In the 1800s, <i>nursing</i> was not regarded as a respectable profession. <br>
People thought that in a month or two, nurses could learn everything they needed to know. <br>
Throughout her career, Nightingale demonstrated that nursing is about more than just carrying out medical orders; <br>
it's also about advancing health (Arnone and Vitzsimons, 2015). <br>
Developing critical thinking skills for patients was a major game-changer for the nursing profession. <br>
Instead than focusing only on the symptoms that the doctor may believe to be the patient's cause of illness, <br>
nurses began to consider the patient's general health. <br>
According to Nightingale, being a nurse is a calling to support patients' physical and mental well-being <br>
rather than just a job title or career (Stichler, 2014).<br>
